                Let's keep this simple 💡. The Recipy Bot doesn't ❌ collect any personal identifiable 👀 information from you. 
                During a conversation, if the bot asks your name, it doesn't ❎ actually store it anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                The information collected in the @Html.ActionLink("contact us form", "Contact", "Home") will strictly 🔒 be used to communicate back to you 💌.
